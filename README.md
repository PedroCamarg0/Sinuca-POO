# 🎱 Sinuca POO

This project is a Java-based pool game developed using AWT and Swing for the graphical user interface. It aims to simulate a pool match while applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## 📌 Features

- 🎮 Simulation of a pool table with basic physics.
- 👤 Player management and scoring system.
- 🖱️ Mouse-controlled gameplay.
- 🖼️ Graphical interface built with AWT and Swing.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main files:

- `Main.java`: Main class that initiates the game.
- `Mesa.java`: Represents the pool table and manages graphical elements.
- `Bola.java`: Defines the properties and behaviors of the balls.
- `Jogador.java`: Manages player information.
- `Jogo.java`: Controls the main game logic.
- `Menu.java`: Implements the game's main menu.
- `meuMouse.java`: Handles mouse events for gameplay.
- `Vetor.java`: Assists with physics calculations and movement.
- `Constantes.java`: Stores constant values used throughout the game.

## 🖼️ Visual Assets

The project includes the following visual assets:

- `Mesa720.png`: Background image representing the pool table.
- `imagemMenu.jpg`: Image used in the game's main menu.
